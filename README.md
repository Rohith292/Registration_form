# Registration_form

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and PHP. The application allows users to fill out an online application/registration form. Upon submission, the form data is dynamically displayed on the browser with formatting and styling. The application can be hosted on a cloud platform for public access.

Features

Dynamic Form Validation: Validates user inputs for required fields using JavaScript and jQuery.

Real-time Feedback: Displays a confirmation section with user-submitted data upon successful form submission.

Server-Side Handling: Processes form data using PHP and provides a response.

Responsive Design: Styled with CSS for a clean and mobile-friendly interface.

Cloud Deployment: Can be hosted on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or a custom PHP server.

How It Works

Form Submission: Users fill out the form with their details (Name, Email, Phone, and Address).

JavaScript Validation: Form fields are validated using JavaScript/jQuery before submission.

PHP Processing: The submitted data is sent to a PHP script (submit.php) for processing and optionally stored or displayed.

Dynamic Display: The application displays the entered data in a formatted view on the browser.
